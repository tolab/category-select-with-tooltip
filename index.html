<li class="data-content">Father and son dead in apparent murder suicide. The deaths reportedly come shortly after events connected to a child custody battle. Police say Stephens had his son, Shane, for the weekend and was supposed to return the boy to his mother\'s house in St. Helens but never showed up. During a Jan. 22 hearing, Davis told Columbia County Judge Steve Reed that Stephens had threatened to kill her, an allegation Stephens denied in court, according to a recording of the hearing. Davis also accused Stephens of fleeing to Fiji with another child, who is now an adult, in order to prevent her from having custody. -- The judge told them it was a classic "he said, she said" but that the alleged threats were very serious, the recording showed. Despite that, Reed increased the amount of visitation granted to Stephens, allowing alternate weekend visitations. When Davis said she was concerned he might take off with the child, the judge told her the FBI would track him down, the recording revealed.</li>

<li class="data-content">Father and son dead in apparent murder suicide. The deaths reportedly come shortly after events connected to a child custody battle. Police say Stephens had his son, Shane, for the weekend and was supposed to return the boy to his mother\'s house in St. Helens but never showed up. During a Jan. 22 hearing, Davis told Columbia County Judge Steve Reed that Stephens had threatened to kill her, an allegation Stephens denied in court, according to a recording of the hearing. Davis also accused Stephens of fleeing to Fiji with another child, who is now an adult, in order to prevent her from having custody. -- The judge told them it was a classic "he said, she said" but that the alleged threats were very serious, the recording showed. Despite that, Reed increased the amount of visitation granted to Stephens, allowing alternate weekend visitations. When Davis said she was concerned he might take off with the child, the judge told her the FBI would track him down, the recording revealed.</li>
